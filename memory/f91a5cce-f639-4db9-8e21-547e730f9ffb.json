Wicket emphasizes separation of concerns, enabling developers to create reusable components that can be easily managed and tested.\n\nWhile I primarily focus on technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React, and Python, I recognize the strengths of Wicket in building user interfaces in a structured manner. Are you looking to integrate it into a project, or do you have any specific questions about it?",
